* cardgen, version 1.0

cardgen is a utility that allows you to change the current directory 
using cursor keys to navigate the directory tree structure. `fcd' uses 
the `ncurses' library for cursor key input. Therefore, in order to 
build `fcd' you will need to have ncurses installed in your 
developement environment. 

As you navigate though the directories, `fcd' will display a directory 
listing to help indicate whether this is the directory you are looking 
for. Once you have found the desired directory, hit `enter'.

Processes operate in their own copy of the environment, so changing the 
directory in `fcd' will not change the directory of the calling shell. 
In order to apply the directory change in the shell we need use a 
`trick'. In this case `fcd' writes the `cd <selected_directory>' 
command to a temporary file and we create an alias for `fcd' which 
calls `fcd' then sources the temporary file. By default the temporary 
file is `/tmp/fcd', but this can be specified in the alias to anything 
more appropriate.

* General Build Instructions

In general, this library can be built and installed with the following
commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install prefix=PREFIX

where PREFIX is the installation prefix.  By default, a prefix of
/usr/local is used, such that `cardgen' is installed in /usr/local/bin.
